# 1.0.x

## Changes

* N/A

## Overview

* **Webpack version**: 3.x
* **Babel version**: 6.x
* **Auto-pollyfill**: No

## Installation

Add the base config to your SVN externals by following

`_ui/libs/utility/webpack/config    https://svn.coresr.com/repo/libs/utility/webpack/config/1.0.0`



Make sure your project has a local `webpack.config.js` file as your entry-point. This is where local customization is made.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies must be added to your project's `package.json` file. Custom project configuration may require additional dependencies not listed here.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="package.json" %}
```javascript
"devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^6.4.0",
    "babel-cli": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-core": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-loader": "^7.1.2",
    "babel-plugin-transform-runtime": "^6.23.0",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.6.0",
    "babel-preset-stage-2": "^6.24.1",
    "babel-register": "^6.26.0",
    "css-loader": "^0.28.5",
    "extract-text-webpack-plugin": "^3.0.0",
    "file-loader": "^0.11.2",
    "node-sass": "^4.5.3",
    "postcss-loader": "^2.0.6",

    "style-loader": "^0.18.2",
    "url-loader": "^0.5.9",
    "webpack": "^3.5.5",
    "webpack-merge": "^4.1.1"
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Customization

The custom Webpack setup utilizes the webpack-merge package to combine base configuration with per-project customizations. Most projects shouldn't need additional customization, however some common customization examples can be found below.

### Common Customization

#### VueJS

VueJS is rather simple to customize, the heart utilizing the `vue-loader` package. Versions for Vue and Vue dependencies may change project-to-project, but the format should be similar to this example.

**Additional Dependencies:**

```javascript
"devDependencies": {
    "vue": "^2.5.13",
    "vue-loader": "^13.7.0",
    "vue-template-compiler": "^2.5.13",
    "vue-template-es2015-compiler": "^1.6.0"
}
```

**Add to local `webpack.config.js`**

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const config_custom = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.vue$/,
                loader: 'vue-loader',
                options: {
                    loaders: {
                        js: {
                            loader: 'babel-loader',
                            options: {
                                extends: path.resolve(__dirname, '_ui/libs/utility/webpack/config/.babelrc')
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
};
```

## Polyfills

Babel 6 does not automatically include polyfills during the compilation process. Because of this, you'll need to be aware of features you may be using that Babel does not natively support.

A popular standard library for various polyfills can be found at [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js). In order to include polyfills or features from core-js, you must import them **at the very top of your entry-point**. In our case, that would be the `main.js` file. 

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="main.js" %}
```javascript
import 'core-js/fn/string/includes'; // String.prototype.includes() polyfill

// Your custom code
// ...

const testing = 'hello';
console.log(testing.includes('ell')); // true
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}
